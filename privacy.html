                        <p>At Happenize, we respect and protect the privacy of our clients and users who visit our websites. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use information for Happenize services, including the advertising services, promotions,
                            informational mailings, and other offers we provide. By using any services provided by Happenize (“Happenize”), you indicate that you agree to the collection and use of your information by Happenize as outlined in this Privacy
                            Policy. Furthermore, please note that in the event that you provide information to us and then choose not to use our services, the information you provide to us will still be handled as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

                        </ol>
                        <p>First and foremost, Happenize collects information to improve the services we provide and to present you with information and services that may interest you. We also use your information to measure our success and performance.
                            For example, aggregate information gives us an idea of the number of visitors we attract and how they navigate our websites.</p>

                        </ol>
                        <p>Happenize is the sole owner of information collected on this website. Any personal information collected by us is provided by you strictly on a voluntary basis. You may submit your personal information in a number of ways, depending
                            on the Happenize service you are using and your choices while using our services. For example, if you choose to run an advertising campaign through Happenize, during registration we may ask you for, and you may choose to give
                            to us, information such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, credit card information, or other personal information necessary to complete a transaction or provide services to you. We use this information,
                            such as your email address, to send you information and notices about the services you have requested and are receiving from us (“Service Messages”), as well as information about our company, client campaigns, and our other
                            products and services which may interest you (together, “Marketing Messages”). The ability to send you Service Messages is an important part of our ability to serve you, and they will continue for as long as you continue to
                            receive our services. Marketing Messages are optional. Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive Marketing Messages. Whether you receive services from us or not, we provide you the opportunity to
                            opt out of having your personally identifiable information used for Marketing Messages by emailing info@Happenize.com at any time. In any such email, please provide us your name, email address, phone number, physical address,
                            business name, and domain with “Marketing Messages Opt-Out” in the subject line, so that we can properly identify you and process your opt-out request. Please note that a reasonable period of time will be required to process
                            your request after Happenize receives it, and you may continue to receive Marketing Messages during the processing period.</p>
                        <p>You may submit your credit card information online or over the phone when you sign up for our services. We process payments through third party payment companies like Paypal, 2 Checkout. These and other companies we may do business
                            with in order to provide the services you request from us will not retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable information for any purpose other than billing for our services.</p>

                        <p>As stated above, unless you voluntarily provide personal information for a specific purpose, we do not collect personal information from you. We will never combine any personal information about a user of our site with any aggregate
                            information we collect about that user, whether collected on our site or our Advertising Service. If you choose to provide personal information during registration or when using our services, we use your personal information
                            to provide you with particular product or services that you request. If your personal information changes, you may correct, update, or delete it by requesting via phone, chat or email</p>

                        <p>Happenize will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. However, we may transfer personal information in connection with a sale or merger of Happenize or the
                            division responsible for the services provided to you. We may also share your personal information, such as your email address, mailing address, etc., with our technical consultants, third party auditors, and other third parties
                            who make our site available, enhance its functionality, or provide associated services, and/or who deal with you in processing your orders and/or delivering content, samples, products, services, gifts, and prizes. These third
                            parties are not allowed to use personal information except for the purposes of providing the applicable services. In addition, we reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and
                            when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our website.</p>

                        <p>We may collect non-personally identifiable information with cookies, such as IP address, browser type and version, and pages you view. We also keep track of how you got to our site and any links you click on to leave our site.
                            This aggregate information is analyzed and combined with similar aggregate information of other users and may be collected both on our site and on other sites in our Advertising Service. We may share aggregate information with
                            our business partners and other third parties. Such aggregate information is anonymous and does not identify any individual user, and we do not link this automatically collected data to personally identifiable information.
                            You can remove persistent cookies by following directions on your Internet browser’s “help” file. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site may be limited. We use your
                            website activity to assist us in offering you a personalized Web experience, assist you with technical support, diagnose problems with our server, administer our websites, and to tailor our product and service offerings to

                        <p>All personally identifiable information that we collect from you is retained for a period of time after our relationship with you ends. This is true whether you only explored obtaining services from us and either rejected or did
                            not accept an offer to provide services, whether you obtained services from us and later terminated those services, or whether you obtained services from us and the term of those services was fulfilled. In each case, we will
                            retain all personally identifiable information for a period of four (4) years following the end of our relationship with you, or from the date that you rejected an offer of services, or from the date that an offer of services
                            lapsed (whichever is later).</p>
                        <p>During the period of data retention described above, all personally identifiable information will be retained and kept secure in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
                        <p>At any time during the period of data retention described above, you may elect to have your personally identifiable information deleted from our databases by requesting us via phone, chat or email. In any such email, please include
                            your name, email address, phone number, physical address, business name, and domain with “Remove Personally Identifiable Information” in the subject line, so that we can properly identify you and process your opt-out request.
                            Please note that a reasonable period of time will be required to process your request after Happenize receives it.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Please be aware that non-personally identifiable information that you provide or that we gather may not be subject to this data retention period, and you cannot elect to have it deleted, especially in the event that such non-personally
                            identifiable information is aggregated with other such information in an attempt to improve our services or understand our customer base, or other legitimate purposes under this Privacy Policy. Rest assured that in any such
                            event, all such information is anonymous and will be handled as set forth in the previous section entitled “Other Information We Collect and Use.”</p>
